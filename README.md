## Course Description

This beginner-friendly course introduces the fundamentals of GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a cutting-edge technique that combines knowledge graphs with generative AI to enhance contextual relevance and precision. Designed for professionals and students new to GraphRAG, the course covers key concepts, including graph structures, nodes, edges, and relationships, as well as practical skills in building and configuring GraphRAG models. Explore how to integrate GraphRAG into existing workflows to create enriched, data-driven AI applications, through hands-on exercises and real-world examples. By the end of the course, you will be able to identify use cases and implement GraphRAG effectively in a generative AI pipeline.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
